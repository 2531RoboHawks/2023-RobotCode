**Specs: Full Falcon500 Drive and Steer, navX Gyroscope, and SDS MK4 Swerve Modules** </br>

Still Need to tune/test/spend way too much time doing the following things:
1. Whatever is weird with the shaking during auton, maybe was an issue with the navX not being programmed right?
2. Not field oriented during teleop?  Robot drives properly, but it should be field relative
3. PathPlanner/PathWeaver for auto pather generation
